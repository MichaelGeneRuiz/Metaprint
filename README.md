# About

Metaprint is the result of our Software Engineering design project. The
Metaprint web application allows users to track their personal carbon
footprint.

The web application was created using a React frontend (with tools such as
React Bootstrap), a Flask backend, and a PostgreSQL database hosted via Amazon
RDS. The database connection was established using the pscyopg2 library.

This project was created by Michael Ruiz, Elton Toh, Rebecah Huang, and
Patrick Cheng.
