When you clone this repository, you will have both a folder called "Metaprint" 
containing both the "client" and "flask-server" directories.

###
Backend Instructions:
Cd into the "flask-server" directory, open the terminal, and create a local virtual environment (for your sake).
On Windows, you can do this by typing 'python -m venv venv'
On Mac, (i think) you can do this by typing 'python3 -m venv venv'
Next you want to activate the virtual environment.
On Windows, you can do this by typing '.\venv\Scripts\activate'.
On Mac, (i think) you can do this by typing 'source venv/bin/activate'.
Once the virtual environment is activated, type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
Now you will have all the dependencies installed to run the backend server.
To start the backend server, type 'python server.py'. (YOU MUST BE IN THE VENV TO START THE SERVER)
If you want to leave the venv, type deactivate and it will take you back to the default terminal in the "flask-server" directory.

###
Frontend Instructions:
If you don't have NodeJS installed, download it.
Cd into the "client" directory, open the terminal and type "npm install".
Once this is done, you can type "npm start" to start the frontend server. (it may take a while)
###

Do not start the frontend before the backend, it will not be able to pull
data from the backend if it is not running. It will probably break if
you do that.
